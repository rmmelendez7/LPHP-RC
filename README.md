# Low-Power-High-Performance-Reconfigureable-Computing-LPHP-RC

Abstract:

As the demand for computational power increases, the need to develop cost efficient methods for computing is constantly rising. To help solve this issue, our research is dedicated towards developing low power computational technology while being a cost-efficient solution compared to other resources. The project is aimed towards using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms that can be reconfigured and applied for use in image processing, data mining, and medical applications. The objective is to implement the maximum units of soft-core processors (Micro-Blaze) efficiently on a single FPGA chip while using the minimum amount of resources. The process for testing was performed using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The next objective is to design communication interfaces to connect the multiple low-power FPGA platforms for rapid scalability. This allows the FPGA boards to be used in large scale projects and support the high computational demand for the power-hungry applications.
